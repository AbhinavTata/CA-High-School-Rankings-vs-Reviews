## California High School Rankings vs. Google Maps Reviews
The quality of a high school education significantly impacts students' academic and career trajectories, and understanding how perceptions of schools align with standardized success metrics allows for a greater understanding of the relationship between perceived and measured satisfaction.
This study explores the extent to which Google Maps reviews serve as a reliable proxy for educational outcomes, offering insight into the academic success metrics—overall graduation rate, reading and math proficiency, SAT scores, and AP pass rate—of Californian public high schools. By bridging satisfaction ratings and academic performance, this project highlights the broader implications of crowdsourced reviews in evaluating institutional effectiveness.

Our methodology includes webscraping data from three platforms: the California Department of Education, Google Maps (using the Places API (New)), and niche.com to establish a dataset of high schools with their respective geographical and measured academic success traits before performing regressional analysis on high schools’ Google Maps reviews and academic success metrics.
* The California Department of Education hosts a directory of all high schools in the state along with their different characteristics.
* Google Maps is a platform that allows any user to leave public, quantitative (number of stars out of 5) ratings of organizations and locations – high schools included.
* niche.com is a school ranking and review site that provides the academic success metrics of high schools across the country.

We established three key levels of focus for academic success metrics: 
* Graduation Rate
* Reading and Math Proficiency
* SAT Score and AP Pass Rate

We focus primarily on Graduation Rate due to its longstanding use as an indicator of educational productivity and effectiveness. 
Utilizing these three data sources, we analyzed whether a Californian public high school’s average Google Maps review rating has a linear, correlative relationship with its graduation rate, secondary, and tertiary academic success metrics, investigating possible relationships between public perception and measured performance.
Our findings underscore a surprising lack of correlation between Google Maps review ratings and our predefined success metrics.
